1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Discord Account**: You need a Discord account and a server where you can test the bot.
3. **Discord Bot Token**: Create a bot on the Discord Developer Portal and get your bot token.

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lemink22/discord-ai-agent.git
   cd discord-ai-agent
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Discord bot token:
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## 🗣️ Usage

Once the bot is running, you can invite it to your Discord server using the OAuth2 URL generated in the Discord Developer Portal. After adding the bot, join a voice channel and start speaking. The AI agent will listen and respond accordingly.

### Example Commands
